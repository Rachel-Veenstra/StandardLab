# Lab_Sheets Folder
## Created and Completed Lab Sheets

In this folder, you will find sheets created by the "make_sheets" code. They will be pre-formatted and ready to send to the lab.

The lab will run the samples, change the date at the end of the sheet name and send completed sheets back to you.

After sheets are created, keep the original blank copy of each sheet until the completed one is passed to you in the event that the lab needs a new, clean copy. When you have received a completed sheet, delete the empty one and save the completed one here.

**DO NOT CREATE AND SAVE ANY 'NEW' FILES TO THIS LOCATION, THESE SHOULD ALL BE CODE-CREATED FILES**

Ensure the completed sheets are saved in this directory (in their respective study folder) before running the "lab_checks", "data_screening", or "ure_nit_concentration" codes. These will automatically navigate through folders in this directory, and failure to properly organize data will result in an error message.
