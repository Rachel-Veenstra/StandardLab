# Student_Lists Folder
## Original Master Sample ID Lists

In this folder, save the original files with lists of samples in each experiment. 

This should be a **.csv file** with **one column and no headers.**

The "make_sheets" code will automatically duplicate samples, **DO NOT** duplicate samples in your list.

Create a new list for each experiment/location and **DO NOT** save them in new folder. Save each sheet **directly** into this folder.

Naming is standardized and understood in a specific way by the codes, so be sure to properly name your list file.

**Example: LMR_KS_USB**
- This file will be understood, used to create sheets, and matched with other files later in the analysis process. 
- This format ('x_x_x') must be followed, even if there is only one location in a study:
> - MS_GH_LI
> - RV_#_CTS

After sheets created with your list, they will be automatically moved to a "Completed" folder in this directory. **LEAVE THESE LISTS IN THIS FOLDER.**

Failure to properly organize data will result in an error message when the final "ure_nit_concentration" code is run.
