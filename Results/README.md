# Results Folder
## Final Code Outputs

In this folder, you will find results sheets created by the "ure_nit_concentration" code. Each experiment/location will have two sheets saved here - one for ureides and one for nitrates.

These sheets are generated by pulling Sample ID information for the experiment/location from the "Completed" folder of the "Student_Lists" directory, and absorbance information for the experiment/location from the "Completed" folder of the experiment/location folder in the "Lab_Sheets" directory.

After results are generated, files in the "Student_Lists" folder are moved to a secondary file to avoid re-running the same lists multiple times.

Errors generated when running codes to retrieve these values are commonly due to orgnanizational problems. Navigation and file retrieval are automated, so ensure that the files listed above are located in the correct folders.
